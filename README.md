## Project Goals 

For more background and context see lecture [Understanding the Functional Effects of Genetic Variation At Scale](https://youtu.be/ChzOPm1-YfI?t=350)

UltraGene tackles a significant challenge in precision genomic medicine: the limited understanding of the functions of most human genetic variants. A large number of genetic variants found in clinical settings are categorized as Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS), creating obstacles in clinical decision-making due to their unclear association with diseases. This problem is particularly severe for individuals from underrepresented research populations, thereby intensifying existing healthcare inequities.

The aim of this project is to enhance the clinical utility of precision genomic medicine.

Individuals will be able to upload their genetic data to be checked against:

1. **Functional Data from Multiplex Assays of Variant Effects (MAVEs)**: This involves acquiring data through Saturation Genome Editing to determine the functional impact of missense genetic variants.
2. **AlphaMissense In Silico Prediction**: Utilizing AlphaMissense, an in silico prediction tool, to assess the impact of missense variants on VUS, enhancing our understanding of their potential effects.
3. **Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) Analysis**: Integrating data from OMIM to understand inheritance patterns of genes, particularly focusing on whether mutations in a single allele or both alleles contribute to disease development.

This multifaceted approach is designed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of genetic variants, particularly VUS, thereby facilitating more informed clinical decisions and contributing to more equitable and effective genomic medicine practices.
